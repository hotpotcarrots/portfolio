# Learning VS Code and Setting Up GitHub

When I first opened **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, it felt like a lot to take in.  
I wanted to use it not just to write code, but also to connect it with **GitHub** so I could track projects and share them.  
Here’s how I learned, step by step.

---

## Step 1: Installing and Opening VS Code

- I downloaded VS Code from the [official site](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
- After installing, I opened a simple folder on my computer so I could treat it like a small project.  
- Learning the **Explorer panel** helped me see my files and stay organized.

## Step 2: Learning the Basics of the Editor

- I created my first file by right-clicking in the Explorer and choosing *New File*.  
- I noticed VS Code highlights code automatically, which made it easier to read.  
- The built-in **terminal** was my next discovery — pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd> (backtick) opened it at the bottom of the screen.

## Step 3: Setting Up Git

At first, I didn’t know how to connect VS Code to GitHub.  
Here’s how I figured it out:

1. **Install Git**: I downloaded [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and confirmed it worked by running this in the VS Code Terminal:
```bash
   git --version
```
2. **Initialize a Repository**: 

In my project folder, I typed:
```bash
    git init
```

3. **First Commit**: 

I made a change, saved the file, then typed:
```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "first commit"
```
4. **Connecting to GitHub**: After forking a repository, GitHub gave me a URL that looked like this: 
```perl
    https://github.com/hotpotcarrots/student 
```
Back in VS Code’s terminal, I linked it:
```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/hotpotcarrots/student
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
```
That moment when I refreshed the GitHub page and saw my files online was the best feeling.

5. **Using VS Code’s Source Control Panel**
After the terminal steps, I discovered VS Code actually has a Source Control panel on the left sidebar (the little branch icon):
- I can stage, commit, and push changes without typing commands.

- This made it easier for me to see exactly what was changing in each file.

6. **Making Updates**:
The real learning came from practice:
- Editing files.
- Saving files.
- Committing the changes.
- Pushing them out to GitHub.

**Final Reflection**
I didn’t learn VS Code and GitHub all at once. Instead, I built up the skills piece by piece:
- Opening projects.
- Using the terminal.
- Installing Git.
- Pushing my first repository online.
Now I can code, save my progress, and share projects — all without leaving VS Code.

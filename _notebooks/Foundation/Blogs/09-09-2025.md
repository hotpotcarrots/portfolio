# Learning VS Code and Setting Up GitHub

When I first opened **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, it felt like a lot to take in.  
I wanted to use it not just to write code, but also to connect it with **GitHub** so I could track projects and share them.  
Here’s how I learned, step by step.

## Step 1: Installing and Opening VS Code

- I downloaded VS Code from the [official site](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
- After installing, I opened a simple folder on my computer so I could treat it like a small project.  
- Learning the **Explorer panel** helped me see my files and stay organized.

## Step 2: Learning the Basics of the Editor

- I created my first file by right-clicking in the Explorer and choosing *New File*.  
- I noticed VS Code highlights code automatically, which made it easier to read.  
- The built-in **terminal** was my next discovery — pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd> (backtick) opened it at the bottom of the screen.

## Step 3: Setting Up Git

At first, I didn’t know how to connect VS Code to GitHub.  
Here’s how I figured it out:

1. **Install Git**: I downloaded [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and confirmed it worked by running this in the VS Code Terminal:
   ```bash
   git --version

2. **Initialize a Repository**: In my project folder, I typed:
    git init
    
3. **First Commit**: I made a change, saved the file, then typed:
    git add .
    git commit -m "first commit"

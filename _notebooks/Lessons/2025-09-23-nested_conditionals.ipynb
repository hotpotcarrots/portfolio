    "## What are Nested Conditionals?\n",
    "A **nested conditional** is a conditional statement inside another conditional statement, or an if statement within an if statement.  \n",
    "This allows us to check multiple conditions in a structured way, which is useful when decisions depend on more than one factor\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- First, check if a main condition is true.\n",
    "- Then, only if it’s true, check an additional condition inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below uses if and else statments to form a nested conditional.\n"

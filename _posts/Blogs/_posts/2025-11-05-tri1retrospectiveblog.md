## How I've Changed since the beginning of the year
---
At the beginning of year, I knew little to nothing about what Computer Science was even about. 

Since then I've learned about the various tools of computer science and how to use them properly, I've learned various CSP concepts that help me to better understand how computer science works and functions in the real world, and I've learned how to work with others to make something that I can be proud to present in front of other people. 

## Key things from 3 sprints (Tools, Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python or West Coast Travel)
---
### 1. CSP Tools
Right at the start of the trimester, I was already facing issues. From knowing how to download tools to using the terminal, all the way until the very end of this trimester, I'm still facing issues. 

However, since them, I've learned how to get help from various sources, whether it be from google, copilot, or even my fellow peers, I'm now able to confidently use tools like Vscode to create various programs, along with being able to fix issues with my tools without having many difficulties.

### 2. Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python
Coming into CSP, I only knew very basic lines of code in JavaScript, without even knowing how the concepts of either scripting languages work. 

Since then, I'm now able to refer to various concepts for both scripting languages like understanding boolean expressions, how algorithims work, and even things like conditionals and nested conditionals, which my group (Ctrl-Zombies) and I created a lesson. Through the class lessons, I was able to learn these various concepts on a deeper level than if I simply searched up a guide online which would've only provided me a surface level understanding of these concepts. 

As a result, I'm able to work with much more tools than when I first started CSP, allowing me to not only create more complex programs, but how to make them more efficient as well.

### 3. West Coast Travel
The West Coast Travel project was our latest and most complex project that our class has worked on this trimester. This project served as both a test and an opportunity for our class members and I to show off the concepts and skills we've learned throughout the trimester to more than just our peers, to be our parents and students beyond just our own period. 

In addition to showing off what we already knew, we also learned new concepts like how APIs work, and concepts like frontend and backend. Although our class period may have struggled at first, we pulled through at the end, and I'm very proud with how our project turned out.

## Night at the Museum 
---
Coming to Night at the Museum, I was a bit nervous to see how our period's project would compare to the other periods, but was pleasantly surprsed to see how well our presentations went, along with how many people came to view our creations. 

Our entire class worked very hard on making sure that we could present something that we could be proud to show off to our parents and fellow peers, with my team (Ctrl-Zombies) getting on calls together to ensure our modules came out how we wanted them too. And on the day of our presentations, at first, I was a bit confused, but quickly got into presenting my team and I's sports module and its submodules.

In addition to presenting our class period's project, it was also very interesting to observe how the other Computer Science periods did with their projects. After listening to their presentations and looking at what they came up with to present, I think did a wonderful job explaining concepts like APIs and incorporating AI into ones code through their project, along with having excellent presentational skills to be able to explain these concepts using their own words.

## Future Projects 
---
One of the first things that really got me intersted in CSP and coding in general was games. I was very intersted in how they worked and after creating some games from our first sprint, I want to work on creating another game as one of my projects in the future, this time without having a template to go off of.

## Lessons to Learn in Computer Science
---
After going through my first trimester in CSP, I found out quickly that the major focuses of CSP was not understanding how to create superificial code, but instead learning how various CSP concepts work and function. Through learning the concepts rather than simply just the inputs and outputs of code, I'm able to create code on a much deeper level, allowing me to more easily work with and fix broken code, as I understand how the code I created works.

## Analytics review

Since the start of the trimester, I've come a long way from first starting my own github account to making 22 of my own contributions on various projects. I'm very happy with how fari I've come since the start of the trimester and I plan to continue my progress through adding more contributions in the future. 

##  MCQ review, approach, and some mistakes:
---
### 1. Review:
The College Board MCQ seemed like a very imposing quiz at first, but the farther I got into the quiz, I realized that most of the concepts being tested were based on common sense and logic. While a decent amount of questions required background information that had not been taught yet, almost all of these questions had some logic involved, allowing me to answer them regardless.
### 2. Approach:
Despite not knowing much, I still tried my best regardless of what I knew and what I didn't know.
- When coming across questions about topics I didnt know(Which was almost all of the questions) I refered to what I knew and used common sense and context clues to fill in the parts I didn't know. 
- By using everything at my disposable, I was able to finish the quiz, even if I had to use quite a bit of time for each question.

### 3.  Mistakes:

1. Since I didn't know the context for a lot of the questions, as a result, I misinterpreted what some of the questions were asking, and as a result, got these questions wrong.

2. I took the MCQ late at night as I was busy with studying for other finals, and as a result, I got some questions wrong as a result of being tired and sleepy.

3. Even after trying my best to gather context clues, when I didn't have a clue about how to answer a question, I would use process of elimination before making an educated guess, or sometimes even just a guess. As a result, I got a decent amount of questions right whose concepts I didn't actually know.


##  8. Something cool I'd like to share.
---
Overall, my favorite experiences while working in this class would be the hacks sprint, in which we created various simple games based off of a template. Game building was first got me into coding in general, so when our class was first introduced to sprint 2, I was very excited to be involved with creating games. 

While at first I struggled with understanding how the code worked for the various games we were suppose to be creating, through our class lessons which happened after our hacks project, looking back, I can now confidently go through the line of code for the hacks and be able to understand what's going on. Ultimately, while our sprint 2 hacks project was confusing at first, through some class lessons to help me understand the concepts of the hacks we worked on, I'm able to fully appreciate what my team and I built, making the hacks project one of my favorite lessons.
